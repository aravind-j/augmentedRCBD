Description: Functions for analysis of data generated from experiments in
    augmented randomised complete block design according to Federer, W.T. (1961)
    <doi:10.2307/2527837>. Computes analysis of variance, adjusted means,
    descriptive statistics, genetic variability statistics etc. Further includes
    data visualization and report generation functions.
