Description: Functions for analysis of data generated from experiments in
    augmented randomised complete block design according to Federer, W.T.
    (1961) <doi:10.2307/2527837>. Computes analysis of variance, adjusted
    means, descriptive statistics, genetic variability statistics etc.
    Further includes data visualization and report generation functions.
